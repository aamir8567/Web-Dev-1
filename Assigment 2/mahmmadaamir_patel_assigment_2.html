<h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Comments in html are exactly what you might think they are. Comments are basically a part of code that is there to give a explanation of why a certain section of the code is there, and the job that section represents in the code. Comments are commonly used to make the code easy to read and understand. The comments are only shown in the file of the code, and not shown on the webpage. To write a comment in your code, you will use the &#60;!-- â€¦ -- &#62; syntax, and all the items inside this syntax will be a comment.</p>
    
    <p>Not only you can write a comment for 1 line, you can also write multiple line comments.  Multiple line comments are not just used to improve readability of the code, but you can also use the multiple line comments to debug you code quickly, and safely compared to deleting specific lines of your code. Although comments are good for the code, but too many comments can increase the file size, which can make the page load slower, so being very specific and not over using the comments is also very crucial for the file size.
