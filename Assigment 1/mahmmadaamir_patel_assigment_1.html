<h1>Assigment 1</h1>
    
<h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p> The <img> tag is a very usefull tag for a website, because it lets the developer upload a picture to make their website look cleaner than just all text. It has many attributes like alt, src, height, width, size, each of these attributes can be used to make the <img> more fitting for any scenario.</p>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>Am account on a webserver is needed to store your files, so later you can access them or make them available to the public. </p>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
    <p>The naming convention used for filenames required in this course is no spaces in file names instead use underscore _, a dash -, also the alphabets should only be lowercase, and no uppercase.</p>
    <p>This naming convention does apply to images that are being used for the website or application and Same goes for folders names.</p>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
    <p>If a student is having difficulties scheduling an exam he/she should contact online leaning staff on their email at olstaff@cdm.depaul.edu.</p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>
    <p>It is very imporant to subscribe to News postings, because it allows you to be upto date when your proffesor posts any new content or makes any changes to existing content, Not only you will get alerts for things mentioned above, you will also be reminded on the due dates and remaining time of the assigments. Thats why I have personally subscribed to News Postings, and I highly recommend you do too. </p>

<h2>Question 6</h2>
    <p>There are two types of dates for each assigment. One of which is the 'due date', assigments turned in before this date will not have any points deducted. however, any turnins after the due date will get 3 points deducted every day that they are late. The second date for every assigments is the 'end date' this is the last date to turn in the assigment, you will not be allowed to turn in the assigment after the end date.</p>

<h2>Question 7</h2>
    <p>In this course only the 'first' attempt is recorded, and all the attempts after that are just for your own practice. The only exception is the sylabus quiz, in which the highest score will be recorded.</p>

<h2>Question 8</h2>
    <p>There are many consequences for getting a score below 50% in the finals, like you can not get a letter grade above 'C-', along with a one on one with the instructer in which you will be asked to explain your code submitted for assigments, and if you do even worse and get below 40% you can not get a letter grade aboce 'D'.</p>
